### Calculator
This is a small "hands-on" project on Python (learning the hard way). A simple implementation of [Shunting-yard algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunting-yard_algorithm) together with Postfix algorithm to evaluate the [Reverse Polish notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation).
A modest attempt was also made to unit test (in TDD way) the calculation stages.
